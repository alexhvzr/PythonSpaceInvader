# PythonSpaceInvader

### What this progam does
This is a game that uses to turtle class in python to draw and create the space invaders game. It keeps track of the amount of enemies killed and bullet trajectory compared to each enemy using triangulation. 

### What you'll need to run this
The IDE I used was Visual Stuido and runs in python. The GIF's I used to generate the player and enemies are not included as of right now, you'll need to use your own for now. 

### What was the intention
I was trying to learn python, figured coding a game would be the most fun way to start.
